    "content": "## **Chapter 1: The Rose**\n\n---\n\n\"...Give a rose to your loved one, at least once,\" said the RJ.\n\nHis thoughts were all about giving her that rose, but he didn't know if it was the right time.\n\nShe said, \"See, this is how you should treat...\"\n\nHe looked at her.\n\n*Wow! I should have bought her that rose. She wanted that!* He thought.\n\n\"Have you ever bought me a rose?\" she continued.\n\nYes, every girl — everyone, of course — wishes for a rose from their loved one. They deserve it for sure. If you have someone you love the most, don't hesitate to give them a rose. Make them feel special whenever possible.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 2: Yellow**\n\n---\n\nDays passed. Though they met every day, this time felt like the first day.\n\nHe left home and went straight to a flower shop and asked if they had roses.\n\n\"Which colour do you need?\" he asked.\n\nHe thought, *Red is powerful. Pink? I'm not sure we are there yet.*\n\n**Yellow.**\n\nShe likes that colour so much.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 3: Addictive Comfort**\n\n---\n\n
*She is so beautiful today!*\n\n He had never been this courageous. Never had given a girl a rose. His head felt heavy; everything around became louder.\n\nHe saw her at a distance. Went to her and gave her the rose. She was surprised and confused.\n\nShe said, \"Thank you.\"\n\nAfter a moment of silence, she added, \"Nobody has ever given me a rose. Anyway, thank you.\"\n\nAnd he was like, *oof!* Relaxed. She liked it. That smile became my new comfort — my new addiction.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 4: In Pursuit of Love, Found Art**\n\n---\n\nLike any addiction, it slowly demanded a bigger dose. He felt he should do this more often. Buying a rose or two was not enough. He had to get creative. Had to get deeper. Do more interesting things.\n\nDIY-ing became a new hobby. *She would love it, and I could admire that smile.* Yes, it worked. I made small, cute things and gave them to her. She loved them. That curious smile — it is so cute.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 5: The Rose That Doesn't Belong**\n\n---\n\n\"Why are you giving me this? Give it to someone else,\" she said.\n\nAll those smiles ended with the same strange expression. It was obvious she didn't like it. He wondered where those roses ended up. After all, nothing comes without effort. Some efforts are not seen. Or are they not worth it?\n\n*Roses? DIYs? These are no efforts. Those are childish*, he thought.\n\n---\n\n## **Chapter 6: Efforts for a Chance**\n\n---\n\nNobody falls for someone in a day or two. Love is built with effort. Without effort, there is no relationship. Please, let me know if you disagree. Of course, effort should come from both sides.\n\nFor some, it's just a word — effort comes later. For others, it's effort for a chance. Is it wrong to put in effort for a chance? Does it make them look bad or desperate? Doesn't everyone deserve a chance? Nobody is perfect. Don't they deserve a chance to better themselves, at least for the effort given?"
