News, social media, YouTube thumbnails with ominous robots and clickbait titles. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, let’s ask a simpler, more personal question:  \n  **Why do I need AI?**  \n  For me, the answer is painfully obvious: _I’m lazy._  \n  Not in a bad way—I just want to spend less time doing things I _have_ to do, and more time doing what I _love_ to do. Laundry? Dishes? Chores in general? Nope. I’d rather be drawing, making music, or writing code. I'm a software engineer and an artist. My brain is happiest when it’s lost in creativity, not scrubbing pans.  \n  So yeah, AI seemed like the perfect answer: “Let’s make a robot do the dishes while I sketch a new concept or build a fun app.”  \n  **Am I using AI effectively?**  \n  Well, here’s the thing—the AI we have today can’t do my laundry or clean my sink. (Yet.)  \n  But it can make my job easier, faster, and sometimes more fun. It helps me write better code, brainstorm creative ideas, generate images, even organize my thoughts (like right now). So yes, I am using AI… just not for the chores I originally had in mind.  \n  **Wait… Will AI replace me?**  \n  _Here’s the twist—my work, the stuff I get paid to do, is someone else’s laundry._  \n  Think about it: My job, whether it’s writing software or building tools, might be just another task that someone wants done faster and cheaper. And if I want AI to do my chores, it’s only fair to assume someone else wants AI to do mine.  \n  Funny how that works, huh?  \n  So yes, AI might eventually replace parts of my job. But that doesn’t have to be scary—because there’s another way to look at it:  \n  **Let’s flip the script.**  \n  Instead of worrying about AI replacing me, what if I use AI to build things that replace the boring stuff for others?  \n  Imagine a world full of people like me—creative, busy, a little lazy (in a lovable way)—and all of them want help. Not just digital help, but physical, emotional, and intellectual support. That’s an opportunity.  \n  **So… how do I secure my future with AI?**  \n  The answer is simple: **Build with AI.**  \n  Make tools, products, or services that solve real problems using AI. Whether it's writing software, designing a smart home system, creating an art generator, or developing a robot that folds laundry (yes, please)—AI is a power tool. And those who wield it effectively will shape the future.  \n  We’re entering a new era. Product and service development has been supercharged by AI. You can build faster, more accurately, and at a fraction of the cost. The gap between an idea and a finished product has never been smaller. If you understand this shift and lean into it, you’re not just surviving the AI wave—you’re surfing it.  \n  **Final thoughts:**  \n  Lazy people change the world. We automate, we innovate, and we demand better tools so we can go back to doing what we love.  \n  So will AI take over the world?  \n  Maybe.  \n  But I plan to be one of the people guiding it, building with it, and using it to build a world where no one has to do the dishes unless they want to."
