    "content": "**Where Does Inequality Begin?** \n* People often say they want equality. It’s a word we hear everywhere — in speeches, protests, classrooms, and policies. But if we truly want it, we have to ask ourselves: where does inequality actually begin? \nLet’s not start at birth or hospitals. Let’s fast forward a bit — say, three years later. A child is now ready for school. But which school? \nLook around, and you’ll see plenty of options — ten, maybe twenty schools within a small town or neighbourhood. On the surface, that seems like a good thing. More schools mean more access, right? But ask any parent, and you’ll quickly realise that the decision isn’t as simple as picking the one closest to home. \nLet me take you to a place I know well — somewhere in Kerala. Within a 1-kilometre radius, you’ll find four different schools: \n1. A girls' school following the Kerala state syllabus. \n2. A CBSE English medium school. \n3. A boys' school with the Kerala syllabus. \n4. A government-run school. \nWhy so many types of schools in such a small area? Is it about providing quality? Or is it driven by profit? Is it to accommodate culture, or is it silently reinforcing divisions? \nThink about it: Are all these schools teaching the same curriculum? Are the facilities and fees the same? Are all children getting the same shot at success? \nIt doesn’t feel like equality. It feels like inequality baked right into the foundation. \nSome kids get smart classrooms, English-speaking teachers, and extracurriculars. Others deal with outdated textbooks, overcrowded classrooms, and minimal exposure. Some schools subtly inject religious ideologies or gender roles. Others push an elitist mindset. \nWhy are we still running schools based on religion, gender, and economic class in the 21st century? When we split children like this so early in life, aren’t we planting the seeds of division? \nWe love to say education is a right. That every child deserves equal learning, equal resources, and equal hope for the future. Rich or poor. Girl or boy. Any race. Any background. \nBut if that’s true, then why do different versions of education even exist? \nThe Bigger Picture \nThis isn’t just about the type of school. It’s about the kind of society we’re building. When children grow up in different learning environments, with vastly different worldviews, they develop different values and mindsets. Later, when they interact, those differences can lead to misunderstanding, resentment, or even conflict. \nSo here’s a personal dilemma I can’t shake: \n* If I had a child,** where would I send them?** \n* **To which version of education?** \n* **To which version of truth?** \nBecause right now, it feels like we don’t have oneeducation system. \nWe have many — divided by language, religion, gender, money, and status. \nAnd that’s where inequality begins."
