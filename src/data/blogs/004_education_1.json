    "content": "I would like to begin with a statement someone once said — ***‘Students must be taught how to think, not what to think.’*** 💭\n\nEinstein took at least **45 years** before his death to make his great predictions that changed the world's perspective of the universe. Every time, he was *learning.* 📚\n\nNow, in this era, **kids of age 10** are capable of doing great things. Consider a worldwide scenario — a child can now **watch YouTube**, **upload videos**, **search and learn** whatever they like. How do they learn it? Remember — they’re just **10!** Maybe in **5th grade!**\n\nYet, they are **forced** to do *boring math*, **forced** to *copy write* just to improve handwriting! ✍️ These children are *not like us!* They are a **different, evolving generation** — look into their eyes, it’s written there. 👀\n\nThey are **living in a different world** than the previous generation. **Evolution is happening in us too!** And this is how it happens — these kids are *capable of doing great things.* But what’s happening is **disappointing.** We see them **like ourselves.** ❌\n\n***That’s the mistake.***\n\n> **They are a better adapted, evolved generation.** 🌱✨\n\nIf these kids want to come up with **new ideas or innovations**, they must travel a *very long distance* in their life. For a *new Einstein* to rise, they’ll need to go beyond where the old one reached. It took **45 years** for him. For a new **Charles Darwin**, maybe *half a lifetime.*\n\nBut if these kids are **spoiled** or *slowed down* by outdated systems, no one can ever go **beyond Einstein or Darwin.** ⚡\n\nAs the environment and technology change, **human life is evolving.** Generations are becoming **smarter, faster, and more capable** than ever before. When we **design education**, we must remember — they are **not copies of us.** They have *something more.* 🔥\n\nA boy who can browse the internet at **age 13** is absolutely capable of *understanding real physics* more deeply. So why limit him to the same old syllabus? Let the curious minds **feel the power of real math and science!** ⚛️🧠\n\nLet them know ***why*** integration exists, ***how*** equations breathe, and ***what*** they can do with knowledge.\n\nWhen we **force these generations** to learn the same way we did, we are ***slowing them down.***\n\nTake them to the **world of real physics** — because if they can understand something Einstein took *years* to explain at the age of 18 or 22, then they are capable of **discovering more.** 🌠\n\nBut if we make them crawl through the same slow system, they’ll reach nowhere. To avoid that — ***carve them differently, so they can hold more water in the pot!*** 💧\n\nI’m not saying to *force every student to learn science*, but to **encourage them to explore more while they can.** Because they *can.* They are **evolving.** 🧬\n\n***Science tells us evolution is slow.*** But the pace of human learning today shows otherwise — this change **must** occur, and **education must evolve** with it. 🚀"
