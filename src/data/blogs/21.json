    "content": "Some people grow up knowing exactly what they want to be.\n\nI didn't.\n\nI wanted to draw.\nThen I wanted to create.\nThen I wanted to code.\nThen I wanted to start a business.\nThen I wanted to write.\n\nAnd strangely… I still want all of it.\n\nFor a long time, I thought something was wrong with me.\n\n*Why can't I just pick one thing?*\n*Why do I get deeply obsessed with something, master it halfway, then jump to another world?*\n\nThen I discovered something that felt like someone had quietly written my biography.\n\n---\n\n## **The M-Shaped Mind**\n\nThere's a concept called **Multipotentialite**, popularized by Emilie Wapnick.\n\nIt describes people who don't have just one peak of expertise —\nthey have multiple.\n\nNot scattered.\nNot confused.\nJust… multi-passionate.\n\nInstead of being:\n\n- **I-shaped** → One deep skill\n- **T-shaped** → One deep skill + broad knowledge\n- **M-shaped** → Multiple deep skills\n\nAnd suddenly, everything made sense.\n\n---\n\n## **My M**\n\nIf you look at my life from the outside, it looks random.\n\n🎨 I draw with pencil, charcoal, acrylic.\n🛠 I make handmade things.\n💻 I build systems using FastAPI and local LLMs.\n📈 I explore business ideas like dropshipping and \"Fluff & Fold.\"\n✍️ I write.\n\nBut what if none of this is random?\n\nWhat if the art feeds the storytelling.\nThe storytelling feeds the business.\nThe business feeds the tech.\nThe tech sharpens the creativity.\n\nMaybe it's not distraction.\nMaybe it's design.\n\n---\n\n## **The Problem With a Single-Lane World**\n\nThe world loves specialists.\n\n*\"Pick one thing.\"*\n*\"Focus.\"*\n*\"Don't get distracted.\"*\n\nBut what if your strength isn't narrowing —\nit's connecting?\n\nAn M-shaped mind doesn't just collect skills.\nIt builds bridges between them.\n\nAnd sometimes the magic isn't in the depth of one field —\nit's in the collision between many.\n\n---\n\n## **The Hidden Struggle**\n\nLet me be honest.\n\nHaving an M-shaped mind can feel exhausting.\n\nYou question yourself. You compare yourself to specialists. You wonder if you're just inconsistent.\n\nBut over time, I'm learning something:\n\nI don't need to shrink my interests to fit a simple identity.\nI need to build a life that can hold all of them.\n\n---\n\n## **Maybe This Is My Advantage**\n\nMaybe I'm not meant to be:\n\nJust an artist.\nJust a coder.\nJust a businessman.\nJust a writer.\n\nMaybe I'm meant to be all of it.\n\nAnd maybe that's the point.\n\nIf you've ever felt like you don't fit into one label —\nmaybe you don't have a scattered mind.\nMaybe you have an M-shaped one.\n\nAnd maybe that's not confusion.\nMaybe that's **capacity**."
