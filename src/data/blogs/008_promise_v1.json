    "content": "On this promise day,  \n   I want you to know that,  \n No matter where you are,  \n No matter what time it is,  \n You can come to me,  \n And I will be there for your,  \n And I promise to stand by your side.  \n You will never have to face   \n anything, anytime, anywhere  \n Alone!"
