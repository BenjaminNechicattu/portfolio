    "content": "The age of the universe is approximately about ***13.772 billion years***, with an uncertainty of about *59 million years* (according to 2011 studies). ✨ **Wow!** It's a large amount of time. The age of the Earth is about **4.543 billion years**. And life originated back **3.7 billion years ago**. 🧬 243 million years ago, **dinosaurs ruled the Earth.** 🦖\n\nWhy do I need to remind you about this time chart? Yes, there is a reason. 🕰️\n\nNow assume, you are on a planet that orbits ***Icarus*** — whose official name is *MACS J1149+2223 Lensed Star 1* — the **farthest individual star ever seen.** 🌟 It takes ***nine billion years*** for its shining light to reach Earth. When we look out for Earth from Icarus, we won't see life on Earth. Because we see the Earth which is far beyond the time since it takes 9 billion years for the light to reach there.\n\nThat means if we want to see **Dinosaurs on Earth**, we have to wait for at least ***more than 8.5 billion years.*** Even to see the **first life form** on Earth it takes ***5.3 billion years*** of waiting. 🪐\n\n**Observing From Earth….** 🌍 Similarly, when we are on Earth, querying for life on some other planet, which is on a faraway star system like Icarus, we can't find life so easily. Assume both planets have the same age and same conditions for the support for life. It will take ***9 billion years*** to make sure that there exists life in both planets — which is **not yet half of its way.** 🕳️\n\nSo, we cannot make sure that there *does or doesn't exist* a similar planet that supports life! **This is complicated!** 😵‍💫\n\nAssume if Earth is the first planet to support life since the birth of the universe, there is a little chance of finding a planet that supports life. Because the **Universe is so big** and the **distance between probable planets is beyond imagination.** 🌌 If we find an Earth-like planet at that distance, we can't make sure there exists life. Besides, the conditions of a star system are always changing.\n\nIf we assume that the **Sun's rate of nuclear fusion** today is the same as the average rate over those 10 billion years, then we're moving away from the Sun at the rate of ***~1.5 cm per year.*** ☀️ It means, perhaps several billion years ago, **life on Earth was not possible** because it was too hot — like what we see now in a faraway star system and their planets.\n\nSo pretending what we see now and what happens on our planet and star system, there is a **huge possibility for the existence of life on a faraway system.** We aren’t knowing it. Maybe they too. 🛸\n\nEven if we or they sent messages using a big radio telescope, it is of no use until ***9 billion years*** (assuming the planet lies in the Icarus star system). 📡\n\n**Grab a glimpse at a closer planet…..** 🔭 Okay, let's consider a closer planet, which has a distance of about time when life started originating (distance in light years). Always life starts with microbes. When we consider this planet, we can't send a rover to collect samples, because of far distance. When we use our telescopes to develop the images of this microbial or even higher cellular life forms we see nothing but **sand and rocks.** 🪨\n\nWe cannot see them as we expect. Moreover, life forms may vary in all aspects of their
