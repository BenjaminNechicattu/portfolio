    "content": "This Valentine's week, I didn't just confess — I curated something.\n\nOn Rose Day, I gave her a rose plant. Not a bouquet that fades, but something that could grow slowly.\n\nOn Propose Day, Pride and Prejudice — because some feelings deserve borrowed words.\n\nOn Chocolate Day, chocolates.\nOn Teddy Day, a teddy.\n\nBy then she texted, \"Let's talk.\"\n\nWe met at the office. No background music. No cinematic moment. Just two people and one honest conversation.\n\nShe said, _\"You know why I called you.\"_\n\nMy head felt warm. My heart was louder than my voice. I tried to explain what I felt — the words came out uneven, crashing into each other.\n\nSomewhere in trying to love her, I found another version of myself. I started sketching again. Making small handmade things. Becoming an artist in my free time — not for grand gestures, but just to see her smile.\nI tried to make her hard days softer. To be someone who comforts.\n\nIt all came from a real place.\n\nBut she said it was too much.\nShe said she didn't want it.\nShe couldn't return that level of effort.\nShe wasn't cruel. She was clear.\n\nAnd that hurt in a quiet way.\n\nSometimes we love in full volume while the other person is listening gently, but without the same song in their heart. Effort, even when pure, can feel heavy when the feelings aren't mutual.\n\nI'm learning to be kinder to myself for going through it.\n\nI went looking for love and found courage.\nI found creativity.\nI found that I can feel deeply and express it without hiding.\nMaybe that was the real gift of this Valentine's week.\n\n\"The sweetest rejection doesn't break you.\n\nIt reminds you that your effort is real.\n\nAnd strangely, after all of this,\n_I love her more than ever —\nnot in expectation, not in hope,\nbut in acceptance._"
