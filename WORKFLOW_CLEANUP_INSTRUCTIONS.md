# Workflow Cleanup Instructions

## Current Situation

Your repository currently has 3 active workflows:

1. **Deploy Vite App to GitHub Pages** ✅ (KEEP THIS ONE)
   - Location: `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`
   - Purpose: Builds and deploys your Vite app to GitHub Pages
   - Status: Active and working correctly

2. **pages-build-deployment** ❌ (REMOVE)
   - This is a GitHub-managed dynamic workflow
   - Automatically created by GitHub Pages

3. **Copilot coding agent** ❌ (REMOVE)
   - This is a GitHub-managed dynamic workflow
   - Related to GitHub Copilot features

## Why These Workflows Exist

The two unwanted workflows are **dynamic workflows** created and managed by GitHub, not by files in your repository. They cannot be removed by deleting files.

## How to Remove the Unwanted Workflows

### To Disable "pages-build-deployment" Workflow:

This workflow runs when GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from a branch. Since you're using a custom GitHub Actions workflow instead, you need to ensure GitHub Pages is configured correctly:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source** should be set to **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save your changes

This will stop the automatic pages-build-deployment workflow from running.

### To Disable "Copilot coding agent" Workflow:

This is related to GitHub Copilot's automated features:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
3. Scroll down to **"Workflow permissions"**
4. Look for Copilot-related settings and disable them if needed

Alternatively, if you want to completely disable this feature:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Code, planning, and automation**
2. Look for Copilot settings and disable automated workflows

## Verify the Changes

After making these changes:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should only see the "Deploy Vite App to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. The other two workflows should no longer appear in new runs

## Current Workflow Configuration

The "Deploy Vite App to GitHub Pages" workflow (the one you're keeping) is properly configured and will continue to:
- Build your Vite application
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Run on every push to the main branch
- Support manual triggering via workflow_dispatch

No changes are needed to this workflow file.
